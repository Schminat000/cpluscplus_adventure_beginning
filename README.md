# Overview

The program demonstrates the basics of programming. When I say basic, it includes:

- The iconic "Hello World!" statement.
- Variables
- Expressions
- Conditionals
- Loops
- Functions
- Classes
- Vectors
- Inheritance

I've been wanting to learn C++ so I made this project to help me begin learning the language. I plan to make a career using game engine programming and I found that C++ was the most relevant to Unreal Engine. My next project I will be using Unreal Engine and I intend to apply the skills I learned in this project in order to prepare for the next. It demonstrates how some of these basics can be put together to create something bigger in the future.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

# Future Work

- I want to improve my projects next time by adding more detail in the comments like: adding parameter descriptions for functions, documenting the software progress, creating a technical document, etc.
- Make a program that combines these into a bigger picture instead of having it be individual segments.
- Allow the user to make inputs so the software is more functional. Especially with factorials, finding the area of a shape, etc.
